    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>An adaptation of the popular classic Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. It's the height of the Vietnam War. Our main character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent by a Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford)), into the border of Cambodia in order to track down Walter Kurtz, the mysterious colonel who is assumed to have gone insane and lead his troops into Cambodia for reasons unknown. <span class="spoil-protect">During the trip Willard and crew will encounter the worst aspects of war, with things getting increasingly demented the further they get to their goal. They are eventually captured by Kurtz himself, who has converted natives to his side, and has essentially established a cult. What will ensue at this heart of darkness?</span></p>
